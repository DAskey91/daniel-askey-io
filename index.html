        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Let me introduce myself—I'm Daniel Askey, and I'm eager to share a glimpse into my professional journey.
        <br>
        <br>
            Recently transitioning into a software engineering role, I bring over six years of experience from Barclays Bank PLC, where I served as a Client Experience Partner. Managing a diverse portfolio of international corporate clients, I acted as their primary contact, navigating complex technical banking products such as Filegateway, Barclays.net, iPortal, and BACS Payment Services.
        <br>
        <br>    
            My passion for problem-solving and mathematics has been evident throughout my career, especially when tackling high-level issues and analyzing data to enhance efficiency. Recognized as a Filegateway champion within my team, I've earned a reputation for meticulousness and proactive support.
        <br>   
        <br> 
            Before Barclays, I earned my degree from Staffordshire University and gained valuable customer service experience. Known for my reliability, honesty, and conscientiousness, I approach every task with dedication and precision.
        <br>
        <br>   
            Currently, I'm pursuing a Level 4 qualification in software engineering, embracing the challenges and opportunities that come my way. With a strong foundation in building relationships and delivering technical solutions, I'm excited to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
        <br>
        <br>    
            Join me on this journey as I strive to make a difference through innovation and dedication. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!
